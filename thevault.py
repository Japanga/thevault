He is famous for flooding threads with shitty anti-Jiren bait and typing SHITren over 5000 times, according to desuarchive. Like all anti-Jiren jihadists, he thinks about Jiren all day, and will sperg out over CHADren even when nobody brought him up.[1] However, his levels of mindbrokenness go far beyond the average anti-Jiren jihadist: At some point, the detective work of the astute Jirenscholars determined that he was spamming his schizobabble non-stop for literally the entire day. Further, he will go through the effort of collecting any bait he can from irrelevant merchandise, simply because he has nothing else to do, as well as samefagging his own posts relentlessly.[2] He thus became known as The Zombie[3], due to his mindless nature and absence of reason, which made engaging with him in any way completely pointless. In the words of one Jirenscholar: There is no sanity left, no arguments to win, no glory to gain, and nothing to prove. Just a rabid, screeching animal that is the very product of our unending success.")

    messagebox.showinfo("ARTICLE CONTENT", "POAZ (Prince of all Zombies), better known as The Belgian or B for short, is a title commonly associated with the Belgian BejitaBitch who has 600+ images of Goku jobbing saved on his computer, and would routinely flood entire threads with them, to the great anger of TARDkurats. For his insane obsession with Goku and frequent thread floodings, he became known as the POAZ, based on the infamous FOAZ. The newfaggot first began posting in the summer of 2020, and started using his filenames commonly named Prince of All - #. This extreme recognition - bordering on tripfagging and avtarfagging, led to him becoming the Public Enemy #1 of Tardkufags. To fight back against him, the Tardkufags began the heaviest falseflagging operation in the entire history of /dbs/, copying his filenames and attaching them to embarrassing posts that implied all Bejitabros were pedophile moeshitters. Because of this, he started randomizing his filenames and went into hiding. Despite all of this, The Belgian is a (somewhat) respected member of the community, for hosting streams for livewatches of Dragon Ball content. Ironically, POAZ himself gained an obsessed, mindbroken stalker who follows him through the site. This obsessed psycho came to be known as The Narrator for constantly greentexting his thoughts in third-person as if he was narrating a story. He will frequently claim that The Belgian is here, even when he isn't, which suggests that he suffers from Fregoli Delusion. Although POAZ is the name of the Belgian the moniker can still be used against other obsessed schizophrenics with a fixation on Goku. Currently, there is a Bejitafag that is perhaps even more mind broken than the Belgian.")

She is also an honorable member of the chadforce. Here is a quote from CHADliban himself: All great fistfights to the death are homoerotic, and the Devastators are deeply homoerotic to start with— the 80s glam rock BDSM style, the big sweaty muscles, the men obsessed with each other, often thinking obsessively about one another while half naked and declaring that they need one another for absolution, wrestling and grappling each others' muscly and sweaty bodies in struggles of dominance and strength. To that end, Yulaan actually ruins it by being female. She still does all the things that defines these sorts of stories— ripping off her shirt and grapple fighting sweaty and bloody muscle-bound men, bearing her own muscular body in the process. But the muscle worship and admiration of the male form is interrupted by her. In a world where females are scarce, where you can go months without seeing a woman or nonhuman female even while traveling extensively, where Devastator combat philosophy dictates powerful men must thrust themselves deep into the annals of bloody danger and risk and hold manly grudges against one another, where there are many shirtless fistfights between two men who passionately scream each other's name, where you're infinitely more likely to come across a girly rentboy than a maiden and the closest thing to a female warrior you'll get is an effeminate crossdressing eunuch. There's too much sausage, too much manhood, and the only girl on the entire planet presents a feint.")

When he inevitably got BTFO because the anime did NOT return he, instead of gracefully kneeling, decided to double down on his lies and proclaim he still wasn't wrong. One of the pathetic excuses he came up with was that Toei Animators suddenly all got drafted to finish the latest Wan Piss moeshit movie, completely ignoring the reality of how animation studios operate and how much planning goes into these processes. Naturally, there was still no DBS continuation after the Wan Piss movie came out.
